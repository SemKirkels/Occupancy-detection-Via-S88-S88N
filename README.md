# Occupancy detection
This is an open project for occupancy detection on a model railway.  
It uses the S88/S88N protocol compiled by a number of model railway manufacturers. The protocol is open to use.  Occupancy detection is used on a fully automated model railway. This ensures that the central unit knows where a train is.  

# Motivation for this project
For occupancy detection, there are commercial solutions. These solutions have increased considerably in price in recent years. As an electronics ICT student, I thought it would be a good challenge to come up with a solution myself. From this idea, the project was created.
